flag: automatic-page-break
severity: normal
certainty: possible
info: >-
  OpenScore transcriptions should have manual page breaks added to match the
  original score. There should be no automatic page breaks, and no page breaks
  that occur at a manual line break.

  This rule may not apply if any of the following are true:

  1. The original score uses a paper size that is very different to A4 /
     US Letter.

  2. The transcription has many more staves than the original.

  3. The stave space size is smaller than 1mm, making the music difficult to
     read, and relaxing the rule allows a larger stave space size to be used.

  different formatting is needed for different words or characters within a
  single text element.
